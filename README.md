# INTRODUCTION.

CONGRATULATIONS!
Now that we have our backend set up we can start our front end so as to conect it to our frontend.
There's some things that we have to set up. We will create your Tuwaiq 1000 student tracker and we are goint to use Tailwind CSS to style it.
1. Let's create this app with a home page that will greet us with and introduction of yourself.
    1. This greeting component should have a picture of you, your name and last name, a short description of who you are and where you come from and be animated in some way.
    2. Next we need to import some icons and link them to 3 pages. Our Github profile, our LinkedIn profile, our Codewars profile(it should show some stats about the kata's we do every morning)
    3. Last we need a subcomponet that will show your first project, a picture of the webpage in every responsive design look. So one for desktop and one for mobile at least. Also we need it to Have a title that links to the deployed page, a short description of the project a link to the github repo, some description of the technologies used.
    
2. Create a navbar component.
    1.  You will need to set up 3 links (Home, Blog & Homework).
    2.  Set up React router to be able to keep the navbar at the top.

3. Your homework page where you will display everything you have worked on so far.
    1.  It should display all your homework in a responsive grid.
    2.  We want to be able to add homeworks in the future.
    3.  Remember that every homework card should display a title, a short description ass well as a link to the forked repo url.

4. Your blog page where you will display everything we get from our back end.
    1.  It should display all your blogs in a responsive grid.
    2.  We need to be able to delete a blog post.
    3.  We also want to be able to edit a blog post.
    4.  And finally we want to be able to create a new post if we want to.
